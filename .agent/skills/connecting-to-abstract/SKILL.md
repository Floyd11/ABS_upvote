description: Abstract network configuration — chain IDs, RPC endpoints, WebSocket URLs, block explorers, and wallet setup for the Abstract Ethereum L2. This skill should be used when configuring clients, wallets, or dev environments for Abstract, including questions about Abstract RPC URLs, chain IDs (2741/11124), testnet config, Abscan explorer, connecting to the Abstract network, or importing abstract/abstractTestnet from viem/chains.

# Connecting to Abstract

Abstract is a Layer 2 ZK rollup on Ethereum (ZK Stack). Use these values whenever configuring a client, wallet, or development environment.

## Network Configuration

| Property | Mainnet | Testnet |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Network name | Abstract | Abstract Testnet |
| Chain ID | `2741` | `11124` |
| RPC | `https://api.mainnet.abs.xyz` | `https://api.testnet.abs.xyz` |
| WebSocket | `wss://api.mainnet.abs.xyz/ws` | `wss://api.testnet.abs.xyz/ws` |
| Block explorer | `https://abscan.org` | `https://sepolia.abscan.org` |
| Verify API | `https://api.abscan.org/api` | `https://api-sepolia.abscan.org/api` |
| Block time | ~200ms | ~100ms |
| Currency | ETH | ETH |

## Viem Chain Config

```ts
import { abstract, abstractTestnet } from "viem/chains";
```

Both chains are exported from `viem/chains` — no manual configuration needed.

## Testnet ETH

Get testnet ETH from faucets or bridge from Sepolia. See [Faucets](https://docs.abs.xyz/tooling/faucets).

## Additional RPC Providers

For production traffic beyond the default public endpoints, see [RPC Providers](https://docs.abs.xyz/ecosystem/rpc-providers) for Alchemy, QuickNode, and other options.

## Deployed Contracts

For WETH, USDC, USDT, Uniswap, Safe, Seaport, ERC-8004 registries, and other infrastructure contract addresses, see `references/deployed-contracts.md`.
